A System for detecting eye diseases

We develop a prolog-based system to detect eye problems. This system asks some questions to find out what your problem is.These questions are written in Persian. <br />
We collect our information from the website of Noor eye hospital(www.noorvision.com) and Wikipedia. <br />
Special Thanks to Dr.Javani who reviewed our knowledge base. <br />
You can also find more information about this project in the pdf file. <br />
